When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If need to access from another machine. If ready to commit to Git Hub.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Just to make sure you are working on the latest branch.
