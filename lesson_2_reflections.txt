What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates the .git directory. So as to track the history of the files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a temporary holding place before commiting to the main repository. The working directory is the local directory.
The staging area files will be tracked if commited.
